Develop a simple fraction calculator program in C++ using object-oriented principles. The program should allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations on fractions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Requirements:

Fraction Class:

Create a C++ class named Fraction with private data members numerator and denominator.
Include a default constructor that initializes the denominator to 1.
Implement a method cheakdenominator to check if the denominator is not zero.
Include setter and getter methods for the numerator and denominator.
Implement a print method to display the fraction.
Arithmetic Operations:

Overload the following arithmetic operators in the Fraction class:
+ (addition)
- (subtraction)
* (multiplication)
/ (division)
Comparison Operators:

Overload the following comparison operators in the Fraction class:
== (equality)
!= (inequality)
Main Function:

In the main function, create two instances of the Fraction class (n1 and n2).
Prompt the user to enter the numerator and denominator for each fraction.
Display the entered fractions using the print method.
Perform Arithmetic Operations:

Perform the following arithmetic operations on the fractions:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Display Results:

For each operation, display the result using the print method.
Equality Check:

Check if the two fractions are equal using the == operator.
Check if the two fractions are not equal using the != operator.
Display the results of the equality checks.
Input Validation:

Implement basic input validation to ensure that denominators are not zero.
Display an error message if the user attempts to set a denominator to zero.
Documentation:

Include comments in your code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
Provide a brief description of the program and how to use it.
